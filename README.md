# Technologies & Technical Challenges

## Architecture
Instapic is built with the Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, Paperclip & AWS S3 for image handling.

### Dependencies	
- Bootstrap-Sass 
- AWS S3
- Devise
- Simple Form

## Picture Show Page
Upon clicking on a picture, the user will be directed to that pictures's show page. There, the picture will be displayed on an enlarged scale. The picture is able to be liked/unliked and commented upon. 

<img src="app/assets/images/pic_show.png">
<!-- ![Alt text](images/pic_show.png?raw=true) -->

Posting a comment required a user to be signed in. Deleting a comment is restricted to only the user it belongs to.
```
#comments.row
.col-md-12
  %br
  - @pic.comments.each do |comment|
    %div.pb-5
      %p #{content_tag(:strong, "#{comment.user.username}")} #{comment.body}
      %small.comment_time= "#{time_ago_in_words(comment.created_at)} ago" 
      - if user_signed_in? && current_user.id == comment.user_id
        = link_to 'Delete', [comment.pic, comment], method: :delete, data: { confirm: "Delete Comment?" }
  %br
  
- if user_signed_in?
  = render 'comments/form'
```

## Picture Upload
Users also have the ability to upload their own pictures if logged in. Uploaded pictures will be added to the entire index of pictures and render on the main page. 

<img src="app/assets/images/add_pic.png">
<!-- ![Alt text](images/add_pic.png?raw=true) -->

Uploading pictures is handled using paperclip:
models/pic.rb
```
has_attached_file :image, :styles => { medium: "300x300>", thumb: "100x100>" }
validates_attachment_content_type :image, :content_type => /\Aimage\/.*\Z/
```
views/pics/show.html.haml
```
.panel.heading.pic_image
  = image_tag @pic.image.url
.panel-body
  %h1= @pic.title
  %p= @pic.description
```

## User Profile
The user profile is accessible through the navigation bar. The user can view the number of pictures he/she has posted as well as the pictures that they've liked.
