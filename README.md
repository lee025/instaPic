Posting a comment required a user to be signed in. Deleting a comment is restricted to only the user it belongs to.
```
#comments.row
.col-md-12
  %br
  - @pic.comments.each do |comment|
    %div.pb-5
      %p #{content_tag(:strong, "#{comment.user.username}")} #{comment.body}
      %small.comment_time= "#{time_ago_in_words(comment.created_at)} ago" 
      - if user_signed_in? && current_user.id == comment.user_id
        = link_to 'Delete', [comment.pic, comment], method: :delete, data: { confirm: "Delete Comment?" }
  %br
  
- if user_signed_in?
  = render 'comments/form'
```

## Picture Upload
Users also have the ability to upload their own pictures if logged in. Uploaded pictures will be added to the entire index of pictures and render on the main page. 

<!-- <img src="images/add_pic.png"> -->
![Alt text](images/add_pic.png?raw=true)

Uploading pictures is handled using paperclip:
models/pic.rb
```
has_attached_file :image, :styles => { medium: "300x300>", thumb: "100x100>" }
validates_attachment_content_type :image, :content_type => /\Aimage\/.*\Z/
```
views/pics/show.html.haml
```
.panel.heading.pic_image
  = image_tag @pic.image.url
.panel-body
  %h1= @pic.title
  %p= @pic.description
```
